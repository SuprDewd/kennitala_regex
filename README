The listed programs were used to generate all valid Icelandic
[kennitala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennitala), then create a DFA that
recognizes them. This DFA was then minimized with
[this](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~ava/DFA_minimizer.cc) program.

The next step is then to convert this DFA into a regular expression.
